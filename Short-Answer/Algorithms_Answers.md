#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - Linear. 
    When n is 1, the loop executes 1 time
    When n is 2, the loop executes 2 times
    When n is 3, the loop executes 3 times


b) n^2 - Quadratic.
    When n is greater than one, one loop executes per n, and another inside loop executes per n - 1. n * n = n^2


c)
